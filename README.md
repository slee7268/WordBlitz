# WordBlitz
WordBlitz is a mobile game hosted on Facebook Messenger that requires players to swipe and connect letters to make words
from a 4x4 matrix of letters with varying point values. The players' point values are calculated from the words created.

In this project, I'm looking to design an algorithm that finds the word with the highest point value the fastest.

Framework and generating word matrix found in venv/Scripts/WordBlitz.py
