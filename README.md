# WordBlitz
WordBlitz is a mobile game hosted on Facebook Messenger that requires players to swipe and connect letters to make words
from a 4x4 matrix of letters with varying point values. The game is similar to Boggle, but each letter has a corresponding point value that is used to compute scores. 

In this project, I'm looking to design an algorithm that finds the word with the highest point value the fastest.

Framework and generating word matrix found in venv/Scripts/WordBlitz.py

Algorithm is located at venv/Scripts/WordBlitzAlg.py
